Great job!

The ones I rated higher usually had the standard makings of a song: chords/baseline with a melody, some chord progression that sounded reasonable and using notes in that key.
The ones I rated lower (to me) sounded like a toddler hitting a piano at random points. Some had a few good ideas, e.g. staying in a certain range of notes, but most lacked the song-like structure needed to make music. When some of the chords hit weren't major third/perfect fifth to the root note, it sounds more like a mistake than intentional, especially those quite close together (e.g. a single semitone).

Quite a cool project though, I would be interested in exactly what algorithms AI use to generate such songs! Creativity in the music industry seems like such a human-only thing at the minute, so using computers may get interesting results.

unpleasantness largely due to discordant sounds and lack of resolution
--------------------------------------------------
My guess is the two last ones were created by humans
--------------------------------------------------
Very cool!!

This is very modern music.

I'm guessing it's probably too late to change anything but by comparison, CodeParade's autoencoder architecture seems to work quite well. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWxfnNXlVy8)
--------------------------------------------------
Most of the pieces were annoying because of their discrete nature. Higher tones are more annoying than the lower ones.
--------------------------------------------------
No1: sounds medieval
No2: had some interesting decisions but isn't quite cohesive enough
No3: sounds like you gave a child a piano
No4: Sounds like a bit more full varient of No2
No5: has nice repeats
No6: sounds almost horrorish
No7: sort of meh
No8: Same
No9: Sort of spooky, mordorish
No10: goodish
No11: meh-ish
No12: goes back to being like No1; sounds medieval but quite good

Experimental note: are these songs being randomised between participants? if not there may be some ordering bias (at least I feel like I might have some my self)
--------------------------------------------------
Songs 1 and 12 have a different instrument or something that sounds a bit less jumpy and shrill.

Some of these pieces of music are terrible! No harmony, no rhythm. But some are really nice to listen to.
